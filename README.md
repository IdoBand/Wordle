# Wordle

## A word-guessing game where players attempt to guess a hidden five-letter word by making multiple guesses and receiving feedback on the correctness of each guess.

Don't think about trying to search the word somewhere in the devtools because the client receives an encrypted word from the server :)

This is the frontend of the app and its created using:

* Vite
* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS
